# Description
This was my first ever project coding, and my submission for the HTML and CSS course assignment at Noroff University. The page had already been design in Figma for our Design Assignment, and then we were to build it with HTML and CSS. 

I built a mock-up of an e-commerce site called Rainy Days, who sold outdoor jackets to people who loved exploring nature. 
The page consists off: 
- A homepage
- A page displaying all the jackets
- A contact page
- An about page

# Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS

# How to Install
1. Clone repository
2. Open with VS Code
3. Open index.html file with live server
